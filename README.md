HTML: The structure includes a header with a title and a button for the dark mode toggle, plus a simple home section.
CSS: Uses CSS variables to set default colors for light and dark modes. The .dark-mode class applies a dark theme when toggled.
JavaScript: Toggles the dark-mode class on the body element and updates the icon image to switch between light and dark mode icons.
Replace sun.png and moon.png with your actual icon paths. This code will toggle the theme and icon image with each button click.
